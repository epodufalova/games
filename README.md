#  Games

This repository contains interactive games I built while exploring **Python** and **C++ with OpenGL**.  
Each project is standalone and can be run independently. Together, they highlight my ability to combine **logic, design, and interactivity** in code.

##  Blackjack (`blackjack.py`)
A text-based version of the classic casino game.  
- Implements game logic with card dealing, scoring, and dealer rules.  
- Lets the player hit, stand, and try to beat the dealer fairly.  
- Focuses on **probability and decision-making** logic.  

## Rock Paper Scissors (`rockpaperscissors.py`)
A simple yet fun implementation of the timeless game.  
- Play against the computer.  
- Randomized outcomes with win/loss/draw tracking.  
- Showcases user interaction and randomness handling.  


## Snake Game (`snake_game.py`)
An **interactive snake game** with real-time play.  
- Classic arcade-style gameplay.  
- Dynamic growth and increasing difficulty as the snake eats.  
- Demonstrates event handling, real-time input, and **interactive graphics programming**.  


## Rubik’s Cube (`rubik's_cube.cpp`)
A **3D interactive Rubik’s Cube simulator** built with **C++ and OpenGL**.  
- Rotate cube layers manually using keyboard controls.  
- Supports full 3D navigation (arrow keys rotate the view).  
- Visualizes the cube in vibrant colors with real-time rendering.  
- Highlights **graphics programming, algorithms, and geometry manipulation**.
